The types C%, F%, D%, G%, K%, O%, Q, and U were all new in Microsoft Office Excel 2007 and are not supported in
earlier versions. The string types F, F%, G, and G% are used for arguments that are modified-in-place. When
XLOPER or XLOPER12 arguments are registered as types P or Q respectively, Excel converts single-cell references
to simple values and multi-cell references to arrays when it prepares them.
P and Q types always arrive in your function as one of the following types: xltypeNum, xltypeStr, xltypeBool, xltypeErr, xltypeMulti, xltypeMissing, or xltypeNil, but not xltypeRef or xltypeSRef because these are always dereferenced.
Type O, which is really three arguments on the stack, was introduced for compatibility with Fortran DLLs where
arguments are passed by reference. It cannot be used to return a value except by declaring the argument as a
modify-in-place return value and placing the results in the referenced values. Type O% extends type O in Excel
2007 so that it can access arrays that cover areas larger than the Office Excel 2003 grid.
